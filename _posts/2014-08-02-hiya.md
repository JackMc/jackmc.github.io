Hello, world! So this is my first blog post of what will hopefully be many!

So I'm 18 years old, and my name is Jack. I live in Ottawa and I have a passion
for programming and design.

If you're interested in seeing what I've already made, you can go to
[My GitHub profile's repository list](http://github.com/JackMc).
