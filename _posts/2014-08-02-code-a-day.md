title: Two Hours of Code a Day

So here's the idea: I'm going to make one post a day (shouldn't take more than
half an hour) about at least two hours of my day which I have spent programming.

In this case, programming is considered to be the physical act of typey-typey on
the keyboard where the letters are all nice and highlighted. It cannot include
reading technical documentation or any related thing such as code reviews
or an issue tracker. The plan is for this to continue for at
least two weeks, and if that works out, then to continue indefinately, perhaps
with some modifications to the format.

Thanks a lot for reading and hopefully you'll see another (third?!) blog from me
tonight about the work I've done :-).
