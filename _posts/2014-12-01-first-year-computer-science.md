So turns out, university is a very consuming endeavor. As such, I haven't had
much time to write on my blog (:-(). Now, as exams approach, I have decided I
need an outlet and should start writing again.

With the personal cruft out of the way, let's talk about computer science
education at modern universities. I've seen many people walk into my computer
science class thinking it is a joke, and honestly maybe it will be easy for them
due to their prior experience. Heck, the most advanced thing we've done so far
in terms of language constructs is objects pretty much acting as structs (no methods).
But what they don't see is what my class has already taught them: how to design
real applications. Yeah, it may be in Processing. Yeah, it may be something you can
whip up in minutes, but already we have designed a wandering AI zombie apocalypse
simulator, and a visualization of data about foreign student data.

I too was one of these people who thought the class was "too darn slow" and that we
should move on. But then I saw the other people in the class struggling with the concept
of a class or a loop because they'd never programmed before, and I looked at all we'd
accomplished in the class, and I thought that it was, well, pretty damn awesome.

So until tomorrow where I will start afresh with doing my couple of hours of programming
a day, here are a couple of screenshots of what we've made in our introduction to computer
science class.
