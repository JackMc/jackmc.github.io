I'm Jack, a software developer from Ottawa, Ontario. I'm passionate
about application security, teaching/communication and meeting cool
people.

I currently work on security at [DataGrail](https://www.datagrail.io). We're 
not currently hiring for security roles, but if you'd like to work on helping
make data privacy a fundamental human right, [apply here](https://www.datagrail.io/careers/). 

My resume can be found [here](/files/Resume_Pages.pdf). Reach out via
